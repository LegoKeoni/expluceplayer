## About this cup

We’re delving into the archive. Join me for my **ninth cup**, where I find out my guest Felicity too loves the great institution that is the Eurovision Song Contest and we play a game based on best before dates whilst I sip some L’Or Supremo. Originally, I’d hoped to have posted this in time for last year’s replacement event *Europe Shine a Light* – we can see how well that turned out…

**Recorded**: Friday 3rd April 2020
