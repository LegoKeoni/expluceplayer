## About this cup

Goodness, he’s only gone and done it when you all thought he’d given up or forgotten about it! **Cup 2** is a Kazaar, a very strong (12) brew made with both Arabica and Robusta beans. Rachael is my guest – join me as we talk a bit about languages and play a game based on products from Ikea.

**Recorded**: Wednesday 25th March 2020
