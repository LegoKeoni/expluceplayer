## About this cup

**Cup 4** is the overflow stuff from the last episode – yes, we really did record so much! Listen to the rest of the Welsh maraca game and hear João talk about Asturias (for a bit). In a surprising turn of events, the drink in the title comes from my guest – a Twinings English Breakfast Tea, drunk late after the watershed.

**Recorded**: Wednesday 25th March 2020
