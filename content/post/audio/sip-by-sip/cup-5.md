## About this cup

My exams – or ‘alternative assessments’ – are now over, so I found some free time, at last! Recorded near the start of the lockdown, in **cup 5** my guest Jimmy and I talk a little about life in Toronto and play a rather self-explanatory game called What am I talking about? which actually wasn’t that straightforward. But, let’s be honest, it wouldn’t be, would it…?

**Recorded**: Saturday 28th March 2020
