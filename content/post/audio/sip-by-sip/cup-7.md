## About this cup

It’s a Christmas miracle! **Cup 7** already?? I know! Here’s the second chat I had originally for Keoni’s Cave on URY with my pal Callum. I do much of the same as in the previous episode, actually, so watch out for more terrible singing and a moderately disastrous attempt at preparing M&S’s Christmas Blend. Merry Christmas!

**Recorded**: Thursday 3rd December 2020
