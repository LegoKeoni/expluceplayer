## Episode synopsis

**(1/5)** It’s Tuesday, it’s lunchtime, it’s the totally original idea (from Ben Allen), The 3.5mm cable! Join Keoni as he dials it up to 11 in his exploits of radio-based parodies. The whole show is transcribed from [episode 1 of The Aux Cord](https://ury.org.uk/schedule/shows/timeslots/148448/), so it must be stressed that all the views communicated during this programme are those of Ben Allen’s and not Keoni's.

**First aired**: 12pm-1pm, Tuesday 9th February 2021
