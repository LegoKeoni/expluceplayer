## Synopsis

It's the end of term one here at york and Christmas is right around the corner, and our Ofcom regulated broadcast hours.

Join us as we gather around the proverbial yuletide log and enjoy an evening of fun and games as we, the fine people of URY, get together for one last blast of Crimbo merriment and questionable radio content.

So come along, get festive, and enjoy while The Man (read as 'Ofcom') tries to (read as 'tells us to') shut us down (read as 'not broadcast outside our allowed period')

**First aired**: 10pm-12am, Sunday 6th December 2020
