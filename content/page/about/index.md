## Welcome

Welcome to **Expluce Player**, the home of audiovisual content from the mind of me - Keoni D'Souza!

I've contributed to an ever-increasing collection of radio shows, podcasts and have presented a handful of recorded productions. I am - slowly, but surely - updating this site so that people (mainly me...) can enjoy my unimitable brand of top-quality low-quality content.

Organised into overarching categories (audio and video) and series (for continuing content), each audio and video clip is accompanied by tags to help mark regular co-contributors and original broadcast partners (including Xtreme Radio, University Radio York and York Student Television).

So, have a look around - you may find something that you wouldn't even want to share with even your worst enemy...

## Expluce

I started branding everything I made since late 2010 with *KD Group* to add my mark and help communicate that I was behind it. On 10th September 2013, the brand changed to *Expluce* (originally with an exclamation mark), a portmanteau formed from the slogan, *Exploring excitement, inducing success*. In 2017, **Expluce Player** was launched with the aim to host my plethora of audio and video content all in one place.

## Collnod

*Collnod Ltd* was formed on 28th December 2021 to facilitate employment contracts for freelance media opportunities. It is registered at 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE. Acting as a portfolio, since April, **Expluce Player** has been funded and hosted by *Collnod Ltd*. *Collnod* is Welsh for *apostrophe*.
